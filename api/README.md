# Wagerr Bridge API

This is the api server used for the wagerr bridge application.

## Pre-requisites
  - Node 11.15.0
    - This can be installed using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
  - [Wagerr wallet rpc](https://github.com/wagerr-project/wagerr/releases)

## Installation

If you're using `nvm` then run:
```
nvm use
```

Install dependencies from bridge core:
```
cd ../bridge-core/ && npm install && cd ../api
```

Install all the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
If installation fails then remove `package-lock.json` and try again. Ref: https://npm.community/t/npm-install-for-package-with-local-dependency-fails/754/27

If you haven't setup a postgres database then do so and edit `config/production.json` with the database info.

If it doesn't exist then you can copy and rename `config/production.example.json`

You will also need to run the sql script found in `sql/setup.sql` on this database.

The easiest method would be to run:
```
psql -h <host> -U <username> <password> "<database name>" < sql/setup.sql
```

After everything is setup, all you have to do is run:
```
npm run dev
```

## Production

Make sure you have [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) installed.

Then simply run:
```
npm install
npm start
```

To stop run:
```
npm stop
```

## Wagerr Wallet RPC

To ensure the server starts, you need to make sure a wagerr wallet RPC instance is running.

You can do this simply by running the following:
```
wagerr-wallet-rpc --rpc-login <username>:<password> --rpc-bind-port <port> --daemon-address <address> --wallet-dir <dir> [--testnet]
```

You will also need to ensure that you have a wallet created to be used with the bridge. Any deposits and swaps will be made using this wallet.

Go into `config/production.json` and edit the values under `wagerr`.

For development, you can use `wagerrtestnet.com:38157` as the `daemon-address`

## Configuration

We use [node-config](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config) for configurations.

Any properties found in `config/default.json` can be modified to your needs.

For production, we reccommend you copy `config/production.example.json` to `config/production.json` and edit any values in there.


Any values that you don't set in those files will be fetched from `config/default.json`.
